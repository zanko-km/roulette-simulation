# Roulette Statistical Analysis

In this project, we **simulate the roulette game** to analyze how much a gambler wins or loses over a large number of games.

---

## 🎲 Project Description
- We simulate roulette games for different play counts: **10, 25, 100, and 1000 games**.  
- Each experiment is repeated **100,000 times** to calculate:  
  - **Mean** (average outcome)  
  - **Standard deviation**  
- These empirical values are compared with their **theoretical mathematical expectations**.

## 📐 Law of Large Numbers
The **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)** states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the observed results will get closer to the **expected (theoretical) probability**.  

In this project, we observe that:  
- With a **small number of games**, results vary widely due to randomness.  
- With a **large number of games**, the average outcomes approach the mathematical expectation.  
- This demonstrates the LLN in practice.

## 🏦 Casino Risk Analysis
Finally, we investigate the **probability of the casino losing** over different numbers of games.  
- With a small number of games, there is a chance the gambler may win against the casino.  
- As the number of games grows, the probability of casino losses decreases significantly, reflecting the **house edge**.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project shows that while gamblers may experience short-term wins or losses, in the **long run**, the casino almost always wins due to the **Law of Large Numbers** and the built-in statistical advantage of the game.
